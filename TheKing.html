                        <h1>The call of the phoenix</h1>
                        <br>
                        <p>It was an elementary theorem of probability that if you knew 
                          what your answer would be after updating on future evidence, you ought to adopt that answer 
                          right now. If you knew your destination, you were already there.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <a class="btn btn-dark btn-lg" href="https://web.skype.com/en"><i class="fab fa-phoenix-framework"></i>Come over you shit</a>
                        
                        <div class="col-12">
                            <p id="below">
                                ...And by analogy, if not quite by theorem, if you could guess what the descendants of 
                                humanity would think of something, you ought to go ahead and take that as your own best guess.<br>
                                ...Wasn't it only Harry's distance from her life that was preventing his brain from being driven to Azkaban 
                                to save her no matter what? What would it have taken to compel him? Would he have needed to know her face? 
                                Her name? Her favorite color?<br>
                                ...It might be as simple as thinking of the flame, calling for the fire-bird in his heart -<br>
                                Then the new star moved again, and seemed to grow as well as brightening. It looked closer suddenly, 
                                no longer so far away that distance became moot. Like what you thought was a star, turning out to be 
                                an airplane, a lighted form whose shape you could actually see...
                                ...no, not a plane...
                                The realization seemed to spread out from Harry's chest in a wave of prickling, sweat preparing to break out.
                                ...a bird.<br>
                                A piercing cry split the night, echoing from the rooftops of Hogwarts.

                                The approaching creature trailed fire as it flew, shedding golden flames like sparks from its feathers as the mighty wings beat and beat again. Even as it swooped up in a great curve to hover a few paces away from Harry, even as the flames surrounding its passage diminished, the creature seemed no dimmer, no less bright; as though some unseen Sun shone upon it and illuminated it.
                                
                                Great shining wings red like a sunset, and eyes like incandescent pearls, blazing with golden fire and determination.
                                
                                The phoenix's beak opened, and let out a great caw that Harry understood as though it had been a spoken word:
                                
                                COME!<br>
                                Let's go. It's time. The voice that spoke came from inside Harry, not from the phoenix;<br>
                                ...He might die, but if he didn't die he could feel clean again. Have principles that were more 
                                than excuses for inaction. It was his life. His to spend, if he chose.<br>
                                ...."The phoenix comes," said the old wizard. "To those who would fight, 
                                to those would act even at cost of their lives, the phoenix comes... 
                                I thought it was to my death I went, when the phoenix took me to fight Grindelwald. 
                                I did not know that Fawkes would sustain me, and heal me, and stay by my side -" The old wizard's voice quavered, 
                                for a moment. "It is not spoken of - you should realize, Harry, why it is never spoken of - if the one knew, 
                                the phoenix could not judge. But to you, Harry, I may say it now, for the phoenix comes only once."
